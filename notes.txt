Notes

- upload ajax-loader.gif and whatever (jquery) files necessary to website
   also, get local copy of standard jquery, so I'm not referencing an external site

- Add preview pictures to Load Map

- Load Map has "other" size instead of 6x16, so we can include Team Base and Crisis Time Zone maps
	- don't forget Quick-Start maps

- Redesign page so all information is showing at once on left (Select Point, Map Info)
	- Design so it's on a sliding panel, so we can "fullscreen" the map
	- consider removing LoF "reasons" so they'll fit in the shorter column
	
- RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN for mobile
   
   
(optional)   
- Rewrite map sorting algorithm so that maps without a type of terrain are filtered out
	(eg. maps with no elevated terrain don't show up on the list sorted by elevated terrain)
   
Issues to look into:
 - Fear Itself: Paris - blocking terrain B2 and I23
 - Fear Itself: South Africa - G2, G23
 - WXM: Candian Wilderness - check water G2-H2
 - ASM: Bell Tower - check elevated/special terrain division, figure out how to get elevated/indoor displaying properly
 - NML: Dockside (pre) - ticket booth elevated, is it starting or separate?
 -  same for Dockside Post
 - NML: Robinson (post) - check southern start area (esp. right)
 - NML: Power Plant (post) - D3 elevated
 - NML: Blackgate Prison (pre) - Outdoor? Really?  - also, check mess that is post
 - BMFF: Wayne Manor - 17 NOP, no doorway?
 - CW: Negative Zone Prison - E11: pointing wrong way?
 - DC75 WoL FF: Okaara - rows 12, 13, 14 - blocking indoor or outdoor? 1 or 2?
 - IG: Collector's Ship - north start area, blocking included or separate?
 - AVM: Stark Tower - check special terrain, which elevation is it? (esp. north)
 - GSX: Madripoor - blocking in southern start included in start?
 - DC75: Hawkworld - check elevated terrain isn't part of starts
 - DR: Training Complex - T19 indoor/outdoor? that elevated area
 - SoG: Crime Alley - ways to get into theaters?
