Notes

- upload ajax-loader.gif and whatever (jquery) files necessary to website
   also, get local copy of standard jquery, so I'm not referencing an external site
   
- FIX LOF ALGORITHM
	counts outdoor grounded blocking terrain as blocking when drawing lof from elevated to elevated (should be clear)
		if the endpoints are both on the rim, it's okay...but away from the rim causes problems
	rewrite to account for variable elevations (or at least 6) - thanks to Ryut
	
- Speaking of level 6, adjust CSS for this	
	
- add "Want to help? Write to me!" link on index.html

- Rewrite map sorting algorithm so that maps without a type of terrain are filtered out
	(eg. maps with no elevated terrain don't show up on the list sorted by elevated terrain)
   
Issued to look into:
 - Fear Itself: Paris - blocking terrain B2 and I23
 - Fear Itself: South Africa - G2, G23
 - WXM: Candian Wilderness - check water G2-H2
 - ASM: Bell Tower - check elevated/special terrain division, figure out how to get elevated/indoor displaying properly
 - NML: Dockside (pre) - ticket booth elevated, is it starting or separate?
 -  same for Dockside Post
 - NML: Robinson (post) - check southern start area (esp. right)
 - NML: Power Plant (post) - D3 elevated
 - NML: Blackgate Prison (pre) - Outdoor? Really?  - also, check mess that is post
 - BMFF: Wayne Manor - 17 NOP, no doorway?
 - CW: Negative Zone Prison - E11: pointing wrong way?
 - DC75 WoL FF: Okaara - rows 12, 13, 14 - blocking indoor or outdoor? 1 or 2?
 - IG: Collector's Ship - north start area, blocking included or separate?
 - AVM: Stark Tower - check special terrain, which elevation is it? (esp. north)
 - GSX: Madripoor - blocking in southern start included in start?
 - DC75: Hawkworld - check elevated terrain isn't part of starts
 - DR: Training Complex - T19 indoor/outdoor? that elevated area
 - SoG: Crime Alley - ways to get into theaters?
