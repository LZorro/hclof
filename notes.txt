Notes

- upload ajax-loader.gif and whatever (jquery) files necessary to website
   also, get local copy of standard jquery, so I'm not referencing an external site

- Add preview pictures to Load Map

- Load Map has "other" size instead of 6x16, so we can include Team Base and Crisis Time Zone maps
	- don't forget Quick-Start maps
	- rename to actual 6x16 (we have 9x16 :P)

- Redesign page so all information is showing at once on left (Select Point, Map Info)
	- Design so it's on a sliding panel, so we can "fullscreen" the map
	- consider removing LoF "reasons" so they'll fit in the shorter column
	
- RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN for mobile
   
(optional)   
- Rewrite map sorting algorithm so that maps without a type of terrain are filtered out
	(eg. maps with no elevated terrain don't show up on the list sorted by elevated terrain)
   
Issues to look into:
 - ASM: Bell Tower - check elevated/special terrain division, figure out how to get elevated/indoor displaying properly
 
Still to code:
 - tiny maps 
	- quick start
	- Timezone
	- wxm team bases
	- teen titans bases
