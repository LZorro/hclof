	<div>
		Planned features (possibly):<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Pretty up everything - make for a good UI</li>
			<li>Color-blind option (can we use different fills? Better colors?)</li>
			<li>Display Map Sizes in Load Map (?)</li>
			<li>Line drawn on the grid</li>
			<li>Put elevation markers on the map</li>
			<li>Put other symbols on the map (eg. Helicarrier arrows)</li>
			<li>Text Filter for map index - ideally I'd like to be able to apply a jQuery Mobile filter to a select of a size greater than 1.</li>
			<li>Click the grid to set objects or terrain markers</li>
			<li>Click the grid to set characters - including rules for Great Size</li>
		</ul>
